# Video Feature Extraction with ResNet

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of extracting features from video data using a pre-trained ResNet model implemented in PyTorch. The notebook is designed to help in machine learning tasks that involve video data, such as classification and analysis.

## Dataset
The notebook uses the publicly available video dataset from the University of Central Florida's CRCV. It includes steps to automatically download and prepare the data for processing.

## Usage
To use this notebook:
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with PyTorch and OpenCV.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the feature extraction process in action.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Jupyter
